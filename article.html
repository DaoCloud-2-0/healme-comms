Over time, your body will naturally start to feel sleepy as your designated bedtime approaches, making the process of falling asleep more effortless.</p>
<h2>Limit Screen Time Before Bed</h2>

By reducing screen time, especially before bed, you can create an environment conducive to sleep. <a style="text-decoration: underline !important; font-weight: 700 !important;" href="https://heal.me/articles/difficulty-sleeping-can-blue-light-make-you-sick1-article">Learn more about how blue light affects your overall health</a>.</p>
