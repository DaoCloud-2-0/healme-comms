The goal of the website is get more bookings for your services. To do this, it should answer the questions:

- What is this/Am I in the right place?
- What does this person do?
- Can I trust them?
- Does this seem like what I need?
- Can I find time that works for me?

- What do you offer service-wise?
 - Duration-based VS service-based, except for Mentorship
- Ideal client: Experienced depth of trauma, they are ready to move forward and find help
 - Lot of artists, spiritual/magical-feeling folks
 - Akashik records (?)
- What would you like to change visually?
 - Colors, type, imagery, buttons
- Fill out the Google Doc for each page:
 - Homepage ()
 - About
 - Resources (Classes)
 - Banner pushing upcoming events (new module)
 - Has a Wordpress site?
  - rootedunity.org (for her LLC)
  - satyagaiagrace.com
- Classes is most important, newsletter (nonexistent yet), then products

I guide you in reconnecting with the magic already alive inside of you.
