1: How Integrative Health Healed My Kidney

In April 2018, everything changed for me. I felt good and in shape, but after a few energy healing sessions, my kidneys raised concerns. Surprisingly, the emotion of fear seemed to affect their function. Initially, I attributed these signals to the recent stress of being robbed twice. Yet I learned that my health issues were more rooted in past traumas than I ever realized.

2: How I Healed Lifelong Trauma with Phoenix Rising Yoga

I was only three years old when life threw its first curveball at me: Lisa, my sister, died of cancer. Yearning for healing, I turned to conventional medicine. But instead of understanding, I felt alone in a cold, clinical approach. It seemed they sought to 'fix' me rather than 'heal' me. Just when despair threatened to overwhelm, I found hope in Phoenix Yoga Rising Therapy.

3: From Hashimoto‚Äôs Disease Despair to Holistic Hope: My Journey Beyond Traditional Medicine

Diagnosed Hashimoto‚Äôs Thyroiditis when I was eight, my life was marked with fatigue, anxiety, and uncertainty. Relying on traditional medical advice, I was given Synthroid, a synthetic supplement. It promised relief but required frequent blood tests to adjust doses. While this conventional approach offered a solution, its limitations were glaringly evident when many of my symptoms persisted.
